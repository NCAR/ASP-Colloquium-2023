Additionaly, there are number of great pre-recorded lectures from the WRF in-person tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ_1sjucSSZCTNBRM4D3BfEak-XT7TKJo). If you are unfamliar with WRF, of particular interest will be the [Introduction to WRF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzSu-343b-0&list=PLJ_1sjucSSZCTNBRM4D3BfEak-XT7TKJo&index=2&t=480s), [Running the WPS system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIbg5T-aUM4&list=PLJ_1sjucSSZCTNBRM4D3BfEak-XT7TKJo&index=4&pp=iAQB), [Running WRF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yixvMF-g0nc&list=PLJ_1sjucSSZCTNBRM4D3BfEak-XT7TKJo&index=5&pp=iAQB) and importantly to [Boundary Layer Physics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPsotmEqTBw&list=PLJ_1sjucSSZCTNBRM4D3BfEak-XT7TKJo&index=15&t=183s) and [Surface Process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmjL6uxwOkQ) avalailable. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the WRF model code [](https://github.com/wrf-model/WRF) and the WRF Pre-Processing System (WPS) code [](https://github.com/wrf-model/WRF/WPS) \n",
    "``` \n",
    "cd /glade/work/$USER\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/wrf-model/WRF\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/wrf-model/WPS\n",
    "```\n",
    "We will return to teh WPS code later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Change to (checkout) the current version (4.5) release branch\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd WRF\n",
    "git checkout release-v4.5.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "This now stages the code we need to use\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Configure WRF\n",
    "```\n",
    "./configure\n",
    "```\n",
    "You will be presented with options, so make the following choices.\n",
    "* Choose option **13** for serial generic intel\n",
    "* Then, choose option **1** for basic compile \n",
    "This then generates the `configure.wrf1` file if succesfull with the following end message\n",

    "*****************************************************************************\n",
    "This build of WRF will use NETCDF4 with HDF5 compression\n",
    "*****************************************************************************\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Compile WPS\n",
    "Next compile from the right *real* case\n",
    "```\n",
    "./compile case_name >& log.compile\n",
    "```\n",
    "Choose a em_real e.g. *WRF_case00*\n",

    "This compile can take up to 30 minutes so feel free to move onto some of the other project tasks in the mean time\n",

    "* Choose **17** for serial compile on intel\n",
    "You should see a `configure.wps` file when this completes\n",

    "8. Compile WPS\n",
    "```\n",
    "./compile >& compile.log\n",
    "```\n",
    "This should take much less take than WPS (a few minutes)\n",
