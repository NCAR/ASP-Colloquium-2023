If you are unfamiliar with UNIX commands there are many examples of the most basic commands, such as [here](https://mally.stanford.edu/~sr/computing/basic-unix.html) and [here](https://www.math.utah.edu/lab/unix/unix-commands.html). This can be part of a Terminal based workflow or a [jupyterhub](https://jupyter.org/hub) based workflow. Details of the different approaches for your Mac or Windows laptop are given below.\n",
