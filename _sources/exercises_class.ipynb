    "### With these exercises we hope for you to achieve\n",
    "* An understanding of the workflow for a simpler process model\n",
    "* The ability to perform basic sensitvitiy experiments\n",
    "* And understanding of how boundary layer processes affect chemistry and atmopsheric structure  \n",
    "* A baseline diagnosis of output from the CLASS model application\n",
