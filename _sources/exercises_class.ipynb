    "The [Chemistry Land-surface Atmosphere Soil Slab model (CLASS)](https://classmodel.github.io/) is an easy to use code base for examining the near-surface chemistry\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### With these exercises we hope for you to achieve\n",
    "* An understanding of the workflow for a simpler process model\n",
    "* The ability to perform basic sensitvitiy experiments\n",
    "* And understanding of how boundary layer processes affect chemistry and atmopsheric structure  \n",
    "* A baseline diagnosis of output from the CLASS model application\n",

    "### Setup\n",
    "1. Download the relevent zip/image executable file from [here](https://github.com/classmodel/modelgui/releases)\n",
    "```\n",
    "CLASS_MacOS_10.13_10.14_10.15.dmg\n",

    "```{warning}\n",
    "You likely will get the following malware warning with a mac donwload\n",
    "*“CLASS” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.*\n",
    "This software is safe, to disable the warning open `secutiy and privacy` in `system preferences` and allow apps to be downloaded from app store and developers. You SHould now be able to download CLASS.\n",
